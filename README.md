# My First Seat Reservation System in C

This humble project, coded during my first year in computer programming, might not be the flashiest, but it holds a special place in my coding journey. It's a seat reservation system, built entirely in C, meant to manage bookings for airplanes, buses, or theaters (you can be more specific here!).

### What it Does:

* Want to reserve seats for your family trip? Book away! Select the number of seats, choose your desired spots (based on availability, of course), and voil√†!
* Did your plans change? No worries! The system allows you to switch your seats (as long as there are empty ones).
* Curious who's on board? A quick passenger list displays everyone's names and their assigned seats.
* Need to know if there's space for your group? Check the availability before making your reservation.

### I used arrays to keep track of all the seats, wrote code to handle errors and validate user input.
